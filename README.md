# Tune

Tune is a simple Golang server that syncs video playback between clients using Websockets.

## Getting Started

Tested on Ubuntu with Golang 1.11:
```
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go build -o main
./main
```

## Contributing

I welcome pull requests, but want to focus on keeping things simple in the Unix sense.
